Some useful processes implementations to apply on 2D gravimetric and magnetic data:


## Reduction to the pole (rtp);

# Example data used

The magnetic data used as example were modeled with the routines present in Richard j. Blakely's "Potential Theory in Gravity and Magnetic Applications"'s Apendix B.
